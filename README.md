# Full stack application built using ASP.Net, Blazor, Sqlite

## Overview

Game Catalog System is a full-stack application designed to manage a video game store's inventory. The frontend, built with Blazor and C#, provides a web UI for administrators to manage game information, featuring components such as Razor syntax integration, form validation, dependency injection, and HTTP client configuration for backend communication. The backend, developed using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core, offers a REST API for CRUD operations on game data stored in a relational database. It incorporates DTOs, dependency injection, and asynchronous programming to ensure efficient and scalable performance. The application adheres to best practices in REST API design and secure data handling.
